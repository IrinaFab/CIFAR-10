# CIFAR-10 CNN

* The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR-10) database is used as a multi-classification problem with ten classes as the output 
* The dataset consists of 60,000 images already divided into 50,000 labeled images for the training dataset and 10,000 labeled images for the testing dataset. 
* 5000 images from the training dataset are set apart and used to validate the model's accuracy *during* training. 
* The 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There is no difference in the distribution of labels within the two datasets.
* The images are color and of size 32x32x3 (wxhxd, three channels R,G,B) pixels. 
* A convolutional neural network model was trained to classify these images.
